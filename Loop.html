    Ques1:What is the syntax for the While loop in JavaScript?<br><br>

    Ans:The syntax of while loop in c language is given below: while(condition){ //code to be executed. }<br><br>

    Ques2:What is the syntax for the For loop in JavaScript?<br><br>

    Ans:The for statement creates a loop that consists of three optional expressions, enclosed in parentheses and separated by semicolons, followed by a statement (usually a block statement) to be executed in the loop.<br><br>

    Ques3:What is a nested loop in JavaScript, and why would you use one?<br><br>

    Ans:A nested Loop is a loop that is present inside another loop. Javascript supports the nested loop in javascript.<br><br>

    Ques4:What is an infinite loop in JavaScript, and how can it be avoided?<br><br>

    Ans:An infinite loop is a piece of code that keeps running forever as the terminating condition is never reached.<br><br>

    Ques5:How do you break out of two nested for loops?<br><br>

    Ans:You can use a break statement with both for loops and while loops. In a nested loop, break will stop execution of the innermost loop.<br><br>

    Ques6:What is the difference between the break statement and the continue directive?<br><br>

    Ans:Break statement stops the entire process of the loop. Continue statement only stops the current iteration of the loop.<br><br>

    Ques7:Can you stop a loop based on a specific condition?

    Ans:You can add a conditional terminal to configure a For Loop to stop when a condition occurs. A For Loop with a conditional terminal executes until the condition occurs or until all iterations complete, whichever happens first.
